  <h1>Welcome to the Gears 5 Page</h1>
  <h2>Read the latest info on Gears 5</h2>

  <h3>No battle royale...at launch</h3>
  <p>In a conversation with GameSpot, multiplayer director Ryan Cleven has said that Gears 5 won't have a battle royale mode when it launches. That's not to say it'll never happen, though. According to Cleven, The Coalition are "big fans" of the genre and that following the release fan feedback will be an influential factor in deciding what modes to add. <br><br>

“Gears 5 does not include a battle royale mode,” Cleven explained. “We're big fans of the battle royale genre, but we would want to ensure we bring a battle royale mode to Gears in a meaningful way. We're actively listening to our Gears community and will look to further evolve our game modes based on player feedback post-launch.” <br><br>

This is in line with previous statements the developer has made with regards to a battle royale mode where it was said efforts would have to be made to do it right rather than to shoehorn it in. </p>

  <h3>The "largest Gears to date"</h3>
  <p>In an interview with Game Informer, The Coalition's multiplayer design director Ryan Cleven revealed the next installation in the Gears of War franchise is going to be the biggest we've seen yet, primarily due to its wide and diverse range of modes. <br><br>

"Gears 5 is the largest Gears of War to date," Cleven said. "It's the largest campaign ever made, the largest PvE ever made, the largest versus ever made." <br><br>

This isn't particularly surprising considering the vast number of single and multiplayer modes Gears 5 is bringing with it: Campaign, Escape, Horde, Arcade, Tour of Duty, Bootcamp, Escalation, King of the Hill, Arms Race, Dodgeball, Execution, Guardian, Team Deathmatch and Warzone. And, those are just some of the ones we know about at launch. <br><br>

In addition, Gears 5 will feature new map-building and sharing tools which will keep players busy for hours on end. </p>

  <h3>System Requirements</h3>
  <p>If you want to purchase the game or take part in testing sessions on PC you’ll need to make sure your machine is up to scratch. The Coalition has confirmed the minimum, recommended and ideal system specs required for Gears 5. <br><br>

  <strong>Recommended Specifications for PC:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Min OS: Windows 10 May 2019 Update</li>
    <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 or Intel i5 Skylake</li>
    <li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 570 or RX 5700/ Nvidia GTX 970 or GTX 1660 Ti</li>
    <li>VRAM: 4GB</li>
    <li>RAM: 8GB</li>
    <li>HDD: 15GB</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <h3>No loot boxes or season passes</h3>
  <p>As we count down the days until Gear 5's September release, The Coalition has announced some more details around how players will be earning new content and items as they play. <br><br>

In Gears 5, all DLC maps will be free in both matchmaking and private play scenarios and there won't be any loot boxes in sight. <br><br>

New content will be earned through the Tour of Duty system. This will involve daily challenges and medals that you can complete to rank up and earn cosmetic rewards and you'll also get some of the in-game currency, Iron. It will, according to Coalition, be clear what's required of you to earn each item and there will be no premium, pay-only content in Tour of Duty. <br><br>

As well as getting a small amount of Iron through Tour of Duty, you'll also be able to buy it using real-world currency. All store purchases will also be direct so there won't be any RNG causing issues. <br><br>

Another way to unlock new content will simply be by playing - supply drops will happen at random as you rack up the hours and these can't be purchased with real-world currency. If you get a duplicate item, it'll automatically be scrapped and you'll be able to use the remnants to craft new items or upgrade skills. </p>

  <h3>Unanswered questions</h3>
  <p>Gears of War 4 ended with JD and Kait fighting their way through the Swarm to try and save Reyna, Kait’s mother, only to find it was too late. Reyna wasn’t dead but the Swarm were trying to integrate her into their hive and removing her would kill her. But, at Reyna’s request, JD and Kait tear her away from the Swarm. <br><br>

Before she does, Reyna teases a great mystery: she gives Kait a necklace that she says she was given by her own mother, Kait’s grandmother. The symbol is one Gears fans will recognize looks remarkably similar to one worn by Queen Myrrah of the Locust, your nemesis in original trilogy. A Gears sequel would have to explore this further – are Reyna and Kait descendants of the Locust? <br><br>

There are hints that Adam Fenix, Marcus’ father, JD’s grandfather was close to Myrrah before the wars, so there’s a chance that Locusts and humans coupled but it would be new territory for a Gears of War game to explore.</p>
