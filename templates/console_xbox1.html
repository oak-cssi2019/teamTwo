    <h3>XBOX GAMERTAGS: MICROSOFT OVERHAULS HOW ACCOUNTS WORK IN NEW UPDATE</h3>
    <h3>Date: June 11, 2019</h3>
    <p>Anyone will now be able to get any name, even if it is already taken. The system will instead append a long suffix of numbers after it, meaning that various people can have the same main gamertag. <br><br>

  And, as part of the change, every user will be given the opportunity to change their name once. Such changes usually cost $9.99, giving people a rare opportunity to fix any names they have come to regret or have grown out of for free. <br><br>

  The changes come as part of a major technical overhaul of the way the gamertag system works. As well as allowing for people to more easily choose names, the system will now support a vast array of alphabets, meaning that it can support more than 200 languages. <br><br>

  For anyone who wants to keep their existing gamertag, the system will change nothing. Everyone will get to use the same name and they will not look any different, and no action is required. <br><br>

  But the new system means that if someone does want to change their name, they can do so for a name that is already used. It will show up with a suffix and a long number written after it: if someone wanted the name Gamertag but somebody already had it, for instance, they might become Gamertag#1324. <br><br>

  The suffix will be written smaller than the main name, and so will not clog up leaderboards. It is used only to differentiate people with the same gamertag. <br><br>

  If only one person has any given gamertag then it will still not show up. The suffix is automatically generated and its length will be four digits by default but depends on how many people want any given name. <br><br>

  Xbox said it had made the change to allow players "to express themselves proudly in their native language" and "to empower players around the world with more choice in how they represent themselves". The new system will allow for a variety of alphabets as well as identical names. <br><br>

  To allow people to take advantage of the new system, players will be given the opportunity to change their name once for free, even if they have done so numerous times in the past. Every future change will then cost $9.99. <br><br>

  All of the same rules that ban offensive or rude gamertags will stay in place, Microsoft said. <br><br>

  The new update will arrive with a system update later this year. "As we transition our gamertag system it will take time to update all experiences," Microsoft said.

    <h3>XBOX PROJECT SCARLETT: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NEXT GEN CONSOLE</h3>
    <h3>Date: June 10, 2019</h3>
    <p>The new Xbox has finally been detailed, with Microsoft taking the lid off its upcoming "Project Scarlett" next gen console. <br><br>

  The company took to the stage at its E3 press conference, and – after showing off 60 games and a range of other updates – finally officially announced that it was working on the successor to the Xbox One. <br><br>

  The new console will be out next year and plenty about it still remains mysterious. But here's what we know about the new hardware. <br><br>

  <strong>Xbox Scarlett Hardware Details: </strong><br>

  Microsoft revealed a few numbers, but for the most part the actual hardware details are vague but impressive sounding. <br><br>

  It talked about a "custom-designed AMD processor", which it claimed would boost performance by four times when compared with the Xbox One X. That sits along side "high bandwidth GDDR6 memory", it said. <br><br>

  But the most discussed piece of hardware was the SSD, which Xbox claimed will work very quickly, so fast that it is able to do away with traditional loading screens. It can run more than 40 times faster than the existing storage, representatives said, giving power that allows players to "move through worlds without waiting for games to load". <br><br>

  Altogether, that hardware will allow for framerates of 120 frames per second and 8K graphics, Xbox said. It also mentioned "next gen ray tracing" though didn't demonstrate or explain what that might look like. <br><br>

  <strong>Will it be Backwards Compatible?</strong><br>

  Very much so, by the sounds of it. And not just in terms of games but it seems everything else – Xbox stressed that everything will be coming forward into the next generation, apparently even including controllers. <br><br>

  "Your games, your achievements, your progression, your accessories," Xbox said. "Your console gaming experience with Xbox, it all comes forward with Scarlett." <br><br>

  Xbox also suggested that old games will not only be compatible with the new system, but could look better than they do now when they're able to take advantage of the new hardware, with the company saying it would be "delivering four generations of content better than you've ever seen them before". <br><br>

  It also sounds like you'll be able to play across generations. That will presumably mean that you'll be able to start a game of Fifa on your Project Scarlett Xbox against someone who's still on an Xbox One, for instance. <br><br>

  "I don't lose my last generation as I move into the next generation – the people I play with and the games that I want ot play," Xbox said in its reveal video. "That experience should be continuous and always growing." <br><br>

  <strong>What's the release date?</strong><br>

  "Holiday 2020" is all that Xbox have said. <br><br>

  The holiday season is typically taken to run from November to January, but Microsoft will no doubt want to have plenty of time for people to buy it in the run-up to Christmas. So November 2020 is probably the most likely time for it to arrive. <br><br>

  <strong>How much will it cost?</strong><br>

  Just as with the PS5, we have no idea. (Most likely Microsoft doesn't really know, either, since a lot could happen over the next 18 months.) <br><br>

  Previous Xbox consoles have cost between $299 and $499 at launch, and have been gradually creeping upwards. So $500 or so, or the same in pounds or euros, might be a good bet for price – but there is no real way of knowing. <br><br>

  <strong>What We Don't Know</strong><br>

  Xbox didn't give the console any name, beyond its already reported Project Scarlett codename. That was one of the widely expected announcements in the E3 keynote, so its absence was a little conspicuous. <br><br>

  Other than that, however, there's plenty that hasn't been discussed. We don't know any of the launch titles, beyond Halo Infinite; we don't know how much it will cost; we don't know what it will look like; we don't know if the rumours that there will actually be two versions, one more powerful and one cheaper, are true. <br><br>

  But with Sony committing to keep updating fans throughout the development period, it's likely that Xbox will be forced to keep up, too. That should mean there'll be plenty more to come over the next 18 months.

    <h3>XBOX ONE S ALL-DIGITAL EDITION: MICROSOFT REVEALS NEW, DISC-LESS VERSION OF CONSOLE</h3>
    <h3>Date: April 16, 2019</h3>
    <p>Microsoft has revealed a new version of the Xbox - missing what until now was one of its central features. <br><br>

  The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition comes without a disc drive, meaning that people are only able to play games or films that they have downloaded over the internet, and are unable to use discs. <br><br>

  In exchange for that missing feature, Microsoft says the new Xbox will always be at least $50 cheaper than the normal version of the Xbox One S. The All-Digital edition will cost $250 initially, but will receive price cuts whenever the traditional version does, the company indicated. <br><br>

  To ensure players have games to play even if they don't have discs, buyers of the disc-less Xbox will get a set of games to get started with. It will come with Minecraft, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 3 all pre-installed. <br><br>

  Players will also be able to get Microsoft's Game Pass for $1 for the first three months. That allows players access to a wide variety of Xbox games, all of which can be downloaded onto the console over the internet. <br><br>

  Microsoft also announced a new subscription service called Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which will combine a Game Pass subscription and Xbox Gold membership for $15, cheaper than buying the pair separately. The subscription seems aimed at buyers of the new console, as well as serving as part of Microsoft's apparent plan to move players towards downloading games rather than buying them on disc. <br><br>

  The console is available to pre-order now and will be released on 7 May in most countries around the world. <br><br>

  Other than the lack of a disc and the lower price, the console has all the same features and design as the Xbox One S.

    <h3>XBOX ONE DOWN: LIVE SERVICE NOT WORKING WITH USERS REPORTING 'BLANK SCREENS</h3>
    <h3>Date: January 30, 2019</h3>
    <p>An Xbox Live issue is causing users to see blank screens on Xbox One consoles. <br><br>

  The issue was first mentioned on Reddit, where multiple users reported seeing nothing on their screens when they turned on their Microsoft gaming consoles. <br><br>

  The issue impacting the Live system has been acknowledged by Microsoft on Twitter. <br><br>

  “We are aware of reports of Xbox One console startup, title update and sign-in errors,” the company said. “We will keep everyone informed once we have more information to share. Thank you all for your patience.” <br><br>

  Microsoft referred users to the Xbox Live status page for updates, which was reportedly down, prompting ”investigating,” but is working currently. <br><br>

  On the status page, it states that the issue that is preventing some users from signing into Xbox Live been “identified.” <br><br>

  Microsoft said it is working to resolve the issue, but did not indicate an estimated time for when it would be fixed. <br><br>

  While the good news for users is the problem is not related to console hardware, the software issue effectively renders Xbox Ones useless until it is fixed.

      <h3>XBOX UPDATE: LATEST SOFTWARE LETS PLAYERS TO JUMP INTO GAME DOWNLOADS MUCH FASTER</h3>
      <h3>Date: July 6, 2018</h3>
      <p>Xbox games are going to start arriving a lot faster, with a brand new update. <br><br>

    From now, players will be able to jump into playing new games as they are arriving. The technology, called FastStart, should allow people to start playing games after they've bought them twice as fast as before, Microsoft said. <br><br>

    The feature will arrive in the new July update, which is being pushed out to Xboxes now. <br><br>

    FastStart works by prioritising all of the files that a game really needs to download to allow its players to get going. It requires a fairly fast internet connection and will only apply to some games, but in those cases people will be able to get into playing far more quickly. <br><br>

    "With FastStart, we introduced a patented, new technology that gets you into your game in half the time," Microsoft says on a devoted page. "FastStart-enabled games use crowdsourced data to identify the parts of the game you’re most likely to need right away and downloads those parts first. <br><br>

    "You’ll be playing in full-fidelity with just a fraction of the game installed." <br><br>

    The feature is different to a similar feature, referred to as "ready to start", which has been in Xbox games for some time. That usually lets people play an introductory level while the real body of the game downloads, but was slower and less full-featured than FastStart. <br><br>

    The new feature is the main thing arriving in the new July update, but it does also improve search and allow people to group games and apps on their dashboard to allow them to be found more quickly.
